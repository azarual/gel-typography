# GEL Responsive Typography

The GEL Responsive typography has been optimised based on the width of the viewport and the input method being used. We take a 'Touch First' approach to typography, adjustments are then made based on if a primary input other than touch has been detected.

## Background

In order to typographically size elements on the page independently and replicate styles across a range of elements we've established a naming convention that inherits from traditional type measuring techniques. Type dimensions were originally measured from a piece of metal bearing that was cast for each character.

Type sizes were originally named. Catalogs with such names appeared as early as 1592. Some of the names came from the type of book produced in that size. Cicero was a size used for editions of classical authors; Primer was used for religious books ordered by Henry VIII.

In order to stay inline with the BBC brand and audience, each type specification is based on typically British names. The names refer to corresponding point sizes but there is no relationship between the names and other defined standards like the inch.

### Typographic Naming Scale

The following class names allow us to scale elements independently from one another whilst also providing a memorable and simple typographic scale.

- Trafalgar - `.trafalgar`
- Double Pica - `.double-pica`
- Great Primer - `.great-primer`
- Pica - `.pica`
- Long Primer - `.long-primer`
- Brevier - `.brevier`
- Minion - `.minion`

### Typography Hierarchies:

GEL Typography proposes using four groups to apply a scale appropriately across a range of devices and input methods

- **Group A** - Default sizing (feaure phones)
- **Group B** - Sizes applied at 320px (deafult & smart phone)
- **Group C** - Sizes applied at 600px (typically tablet devices)
- **Group D** - Sizes applied when touch is not available (typically desktop or laptop screens)
