# GEL Responsive Typography

The GEL Responsive Typography scale has been established to work on all devices and is independent of device size and resolution.

The typographic scale has been optimised based on the size of the viewport and the input method being used. We take a 'touch first' approach to typography, adjustments are then made if a primary input other than touch has been detected.

### GEL Typography Guidelines

Background information relating to the [GEL Responsive Typography Guidelines](https://github.com/bbc-sport/gel-typography/wiki/GEL-Typography-Guidelines) can be found within the wiki pages and more details on the [BBC GEL website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel).

### Dependencies

- Requires [Sass 3.3.x](http://blog.sass-lang.com/posts/184094-sass-33-is-released) to make use of [Sass Maps](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps) and various other features.

> **Note:** We are aware that [libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/) doesn't currently support Sass Maps and as such this implementation is not current compatible with projects compiling their Sass using libsass. We have our fingers crossed that libsass will implement Sass Maps in their [next major version](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/v2.0).
